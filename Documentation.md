# Documentation

Here's the list of documentation. Don't think that I expect you to read the whole lot over the weekend. I've just tried to be comprehensive so that it's as helpful a start as possible. You don't have to worry about being able to set up a project from scratch in any of the technologies as I will provide starter files which will already have that done.

If you have any questions about specifics things you might want to focus on after having a look through the resources, feel free to message me over the weekend and I'll try to get back to you asap.

## Redux
I've tried to give a well rounded list of resources in an order which will lead up to understanding how to send requests.

  * [The basic concepts of Redux](https://redux.js.org/introduction/core-concepts)
  * [How to create actions](https://redux.js.org/basics/actions)
  * [How to use a reducer](https://redux.js.org/basics/reducers)
  * [This is a free course on the basics from the creator](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux)
  * [This is advanced stuff for asynchronous behaviour which will help to understand how to send requests with redux](https://redux.js.org/advanced)
  * [This was a video I found useful for getting to grips with async actions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Td-2D-_7Y2E)

## React
I know you might already got an understanding of react but I just thought I'd provide a small list of refresher resources in case.

  * [This is the juicy stuff regarding components and props](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)
  * [Handling Events](https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html)
  * [Dealing with lists](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html)
  * [Using redux with react](https://redux.js.org/basics/usage-with-react)
  * [The stuff on where to put requests within the lifecycle methods is what's most important here](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html)

## Docker
You'll not need to know alot about docker but I've provided some basics for you as the test will be using it. Some of the tutorials you may find on the website are in python. This shouldnt really get in the way of understanding docker if you have no experience with python. Again though, I don't expect you to know docker inside out, as the starter files should provide alot of the boilerplate.

  * [Install for mac.](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
  * [Install for windows.](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)
  * [How to test docker to see it has installed correctly. The stuff further up the screen has some more info but its not important you know this.](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/#test-docker-version)
  * [We use docker-compose to manage multiple containers at once. This will come installed with docker and I will provide configuration for this but here are the basics](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/)
